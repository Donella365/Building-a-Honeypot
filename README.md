# Building a Honeypot

## Objective
The primary focus was to build a honeypot and understand the concept of one and how multiple honey pots can be used to create a honeynet. Providing more potential targets, keeping an attacker contained within the pseudo-flawed network. Also to understand the concept of how a padded cell could also be implemented to automatically move them to an isolated area with the pseudo-flawed network.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Virtual Box or WMware
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
