# Building a Honeypot 

## Objective
The primary focus was to build a honeypot and understand the concept of one and how multiple honey pots can be used to create a honeynet. Providing more potential targets, keeping an attacker contained within the pseudo-flawed network. Also to understand the concept of how a padded cell could also be implemented to automatically move them to an isolated area with the pseudo-flawed network.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of honeypot deployment and management.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs for threat detection within a honeypot.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns specific to honeypot environments.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities relevant to honeypot setups.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in designing and maintaining honeypot architectures.

### Tools Used
- Virtual Box or VMware for virtualization.
- Network analysis tools like Wireshark for capturing and examining network traffic within the honeypot.
- Honeyd: Deployed to emulate multiple virtual hosts and attract attackers within the honeypot environment.
